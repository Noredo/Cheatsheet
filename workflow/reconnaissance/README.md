# Reconnaissance

In cyber security, "recon" or "reconnaissance" refers to a step of **gathering information about a specific target**, such as a computer system, network, or organization, with the purpose of preparing for a potential attack.

The goal is to i**dentify vulnerabilities** in the target system, so that they can be exploited and accessed later. Attackers can then use this information to plan a more sophisticated attack against the target.

Recognition can be divided into two parts: **Passive recognition** and **Active recognition**.

### Passive recognition

Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information about a target **without resorting to direct interaction**. This collection of information may be accomplished by researching publicly available sources of information.

Passive reconnaissance techniques can include identifying the target's IP address range, mapping its network topology, identifying its domain name server (DNS) records, and even monitoring its social media activity to gather additional information.

### Active recognition

Active reconnaissance involves gathering information about a target using techniques that involve **direct interaction with the target** system or its environment.

Active reconnaissance techniques can include port scans, DNS queries, vulnerability probes, brute force attacks, or phishing attempts. The purpose of active reconnaissance is to discover additional information about the target, such as available services, security vulnerabilities, passwords, IP addresses, etc.

:warning:Warning : Despite Passive recognition, active reconnaissance may be **illegal** if carried out without prior authorization from the target, as it may be considered a violation of privacy or an attempt to break into a computer system.&#x20;
